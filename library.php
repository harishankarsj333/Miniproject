  <h2 align="center"><p align="center">Established in 1977, the University Library is fully automated and one of the best scientific and technical libraries in the country. It has built up a balanced and rich collection on all branches of Science and Technology, as well as books of general interest in various subject fields. The KOHA FOSS package, a user-friendly library management software that supports all in-house activities of the library is installed here. 
       The bibliographic records of books, journals and theses in the Library can be accessed globally through WebOPAC(http://opac.cusat.ac.in.). The Library provides campus-wide IP-enabled access to online journals under the UGC- INFONET DIGITAL Library Consortia and INDEST Consortia, under which electronic full text access is provided to scholarly literature of all major areas of learning like IEEE digital library, Science Direct, ACS, RSC, Nature, IOP, Springer etc. 
    It also subscribes to online databases like Manupatra, Emerald, Proquest, CMIE Prowess and SciFinder. Members can avail inter-library loan service and document delivery service from DELNET for books and journal articles not available in the library. An Institutional Repository "Dyuthi" where research publications and Ph.D. theses of the University are available online to the public is also housed in library. </h2>
